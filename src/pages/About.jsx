                <p>Here, you'll find a collection of projects, big and small, born from a love of tinkering with my favorite languages—especially JavaScript. Whether it's a quirky side experiment or a full-fledged app, there's always something brewing.</p>

                <p>See something that sparks your interest? I'd love to hear your thoughts—or even collaborate! Feel free to reach out via the contact page.</p>

                <p>Enjoy your stay!</p>
